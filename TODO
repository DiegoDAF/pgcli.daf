* [X] Autocomplete \n with loaded named queries
* [X] Reload named queries without restarting (\nr) - v4.3.14
* [X] autocomplete set role command with roles. - v4.3.15

* [ ] ssh_tunnel.py: Pass `host_pkey_directories=[]` to SSHTunnelForwarder to prevent
      sshtunnel from scanning ~/.ssh/ for key files (id_ecdsa, id_rsa, etc.) and prompting
      for passphrases. Keep `allow_agent=True` so it uses keys loaded in ssh-agent.
      File: pgcli/ssh_tunnel.py, line ~140 (params dict in start_tunnel method).
      See: sshtunnel.py get_keys() method - it iterates host_pkey_directories looking for id_* files.
* [ ] Add coverage.

* [ ] Refactor to sqlcompletion to consume the text from left to right and use a state machine to suggest cols or tables instead of relying on hacks.
* [ ] Add a few more special commands. (\l pattern, \dp, \ds, \dy, \z etc)
* [ ] Refactor pgspecial.py to a class. 
* [ ] Show/hide docs for a statement using a keybinding.
* [ ] Check how to add the name of the table before printing the table.
* [ ] Add a new trigger for M-/ that does naive completion.
* [ ] New Feature List - Write the current version to config file. At launch if the version has changed, display the changelog between the two versions.
* [ ] Add a test for 'select * from custom.abc where custom.abc.' should suggest columns from abc.
* [ ] pgexecute columns(), tables() etc can be just cursors instead of fetchall()
* [ ] Add colorschemes in config file.
